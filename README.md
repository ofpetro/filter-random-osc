## Filter random frequency, fixed amplitude oscillation

These are MATLAB scripts that i wrote some years ago and may be useful in a wide range of applications, but i haven't developed it since the initial setup. The general purpose is when you have a series of data which is oscillating between 2 values (with bigger difference than computing precision) with a random frequency to sort the series into a lower and higher estimator series. My example case for which i tested and documented the scripts was that of the Thorlabs PAX1000 polarimeter which for some reason yet to be discovered sometimes produces such results.

See `doc_*` dirs for details and feel free to experiment with what you find, and maybe add pull requests, i'd highly appreciate them!
